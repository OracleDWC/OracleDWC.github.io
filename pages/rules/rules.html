            <summary class="summary__content">Actions</summary>
            <p class="details__body">The four types of actions are attack actions, move
              actions, full-round actions, and free actions.
              Every round, on your turn, you may take an attack action
              and a move action (in either order), two move actions, or
              one full-round action. You may also perform one or more
              free actions along with any of these combinations.</p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Attack Action:</span>
              An attack action allows you to make
              one attack or do some similar action. Not all attack
              actions involve making attacks (some skill checks count as
              attack actions, for example).
            </p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Move Action:</span>
              A move action allows you to move or
              perform some similar action (such as stand up, if you’ve
              been knocked prone). Not all move actions involve movement
              (drawing a weapon, for example, is a move action).
              If none of your actions in a round involve literal movement
              from one location to another, you can take a free
              5-foot step.
            </p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Full Round Action:</span>
              Some activities take more time
              than a single attack or move action. If you take a fullround
              action, it replaces both your move and your attack
              action for the round.
            </p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Free Action:</span>
              Some activities, such as saying a few
              words, don’t take up even a fraction of an action. You can
              take these actions in addition to your other actions. The
              GM may limit the number of free actions a character can
              undertake in a single round.

            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Charge:</span>
              You can charge an opponent, but doing so is a
              full-round action (it replaces both your attack action and
              your move action). When making a charge, you move in a
              straight line for up to twice your speed and then make
              one attack with a +2 bonus on the attack roll. You take a
              –2 penalty to your Defense until your turn the following
              round.
            </p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Full Attack:</span>
              Some characters can strike more than

              action.

              One of the best defenses available is cover. By taking cover
              behind a tree, a car, or the corner of a building, you can protect
              yourself from attacks—especially ranged attacks—and
              also from being spotted.
              Cover provides a bonus to your Defense. The more cover

            <p class="details__body">
              As a full-round action, you can use a melee weapon to
              deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe. You can also use a
              ranged weapon, provided you are adjacent to the target.
              You automatically hit and score a critical hit. If the defender
              survives the damage, he still must make a Fortitude save (DC
              10 + damage dealt) or die.
              Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity
              from threatening foes because it involves focused concentration
              and methodical action.
              You can’t deliver a coup de grace against a creature that
              is immune to critical hits, such as a zombie.

              If your hit points drop to from –1 to –9 hit points, you’re
              unconscious and dying. Each round, make a Fortitude save
              (DC 20). If you fail, you lose 1 hit point, and you must
              make the Fortitude save again the next round. If you succeed,
              you become stable. While stable, you’re still unconscious.
              Each hour thereafter you make a Fortitude save
              (DC 20) to regain consciousness; if the save fails, you
              remain unconscious.
              You can stop a dying character’s loss of hit points with

            <summary class="summary__content">Variant Critical</summary>
            <p class="details__body">Each time a critical hit against a humanoid is
              confirmed, roll a d% and implement an effect according
              to the options below.</p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Soft Spot (1 - 30):</span>
              The attack struck a "soft
              spot" of the body, more vulnerable to injury than other
              parts. This is the "classic critical". Simply multiply the
              damage according to the critical multiplier, as for a
              normal critical hit. This is the only form of critical hit
              that actually multiplies the damage. All other forms of
              critical hits (below) deal normal damage, but include a
              special effect.
            </p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Broken Arm (31 - 45):</span>
              The attack cleaved, punctured, or
              shattered the bones in your arm. In addition to taking
              damage as for a normal attack, your arm is now broken.
              You take a -4 on all Strength-based checks (whether it
              be a skill check, a grapple check, a lifting check, etc.)
              except for Jump. You take a -4 on all attack rolls with
              that arm, and you do not deal bonus damage for wielding
              a weapon in two hands. Any techniques you use that has
              hand seal or half seal (if you are using the same hand that
              is broken) component incur a 15% failure chance, which
              stacks with any penalties for wearing armor but does not
              exceed the normal 95% max penalty (see the Mobility
              component in the Core Book). A broken arm does not
              recover naturally. It can be repaired with a DC 20 Heal
              check, or by healing at least 8 points of damage.
              For weapons with higher critical multipliers: For each
              point the critical multiplier is above x2, increase the
              penalties by 2 and the technique failure by 5%. For
              instance, if your arm was broken by a weapon with an
              x4 multiplier, you would take a -8 on all Strength-based
              checks and attack rolls, and you would incur a 25%
              technique failure chance.
              If a creature doesn't have arms or the DM decides the
              creature is otherwise immune to such an effect, reroll
              the d% for the critical hit effect.
              If it is relevant, roll d2 or flip a coin to determine
              which arm is affected.
            </p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Broken Leg (46 - 60):</span>
              The attack cleaved, punctured, or
              shattered the bones in your leg. In addition to taking
              damage as for a normal attack, your leg is now broken.
              Your movement speed is halved, rounded down, and you
              cannot run or charge. You take a -4 on all checks that
              involve using your legs (examples include Jump, Move
              Silently, Balance, Tumble, etc), on all Reflex saves that
              involve using your legs (jumping out of the way of a
              falling boulder, for instance), and on checks to avoid
              being tripped, bull rushed, or overrun. Standing up from
              prone is now a full-round action instead of a move
              action. Finally, your Dexterity score is reduced by 1. A
              broken leg does not recover naturally. It can be repaired
              with a DC 20 Heal check, or by healing at least 8 points
              of damage.
              For weapons with higher critical multipliers: For each
              point the critical multiplier is above x2, increase the
              check and save penalties by 2 and the Dexterity penalty
              by 1. For instance, if your leg was broken by a weapon
              with an x4 multiplier, you would take a -8 on all checks
              and saves involving your legs, and your Dexterity would
              be reduced by 3.
              If a creature doesn't have legs or the DM decides the
              creature is otherwise immune to such an effect, reroll
              the d% for the critical hit effect.
              If it is relevant, roll d2 or flip a coin to determine
              which leg is affected.
            </p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Nerve Hit (61 - 70):</span>
              The attack damaged an area with a
              particularly high concentration of nerve endings. In
              addition to taking damage as for a normal attack, you
              suffer extreme pain. You must make a DC 15+X Will
              save against a pain effect or else be staggered for X
              rounds, where X is equal to the weapon's critical
              multiplier. A staggered character can only take a single
              standard action or a single move action each round.
              If a creature doesn't have nerves or the DM decides the
              creature is otherwise immune to such an effect, reroll
              the d% for the critical hit effect.

            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Major Artery (71 - 80):</span>
              The attack ruptured a major artery. In
              addition to taking damage as for a normal attack, you
              begin bleeding profusely. Each round, you take 1 damage
              as if you were dying. Damage to a major artery does not
              recover naturally. It can be repaired with a DC 15+X
              Heal check, or by healing at least X points of damage. X
              is equal to the critical multiplier of the weapon that
              caused the damage.
              If a creature doesn't have arteries or the DM decides
              the creature is otherwise immune to such an effect,
              reroll the d% for the critical hit effect.

            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Ruptured Stomach (81 - 85):</span>
              The attack broke a hole in your
              stomach. In addition to taking damage as for a normal
              attack, you now have a ruptured stomach that is leaking
              corrosive digestive juices into your body. Every 10 - X
              rounds (X is equal to the critical multiplier of the
              weapon that caused the damage) you must make a DC 20
              Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of damage. A ruptured
              stomach does not heal naturally. It can be repaired with
              a DC 20 Heal check, or by healing at least 8 points of
              damage.
              If a creature doesn't have a stomach or the DM decides
              the creature is otherwise immune to such an effect,
              reroll the d% for the critical hit effect.

              The attack damaged a lung. In
              addition to taking damage as for a normal attack, you
              now have a punctured lung. You take Constitution
              damage equal to twice the weapon's critical multiplier.
              Additionally, you are staggered. A Staggered character
              can only take a single standard action or a single move
              action each round.
              A punctured lung does not heal naturally, nor does its
              associated Constitution damage. It takes a DC 25 Heal
              check or at least 10 points of healing to repair a
              punctured lung. Once it is repaired, the Constitution
              damage is immediately recovered.
              A punctured lung cannot reduce you to 0 Constitution.
              If a punctured lung would reduce you to 0 Constitution,
              you are instead reduced to 1, and you are immediately
              reduced to -1 Hit Points regardless of your current total.
              From there, follow the rules for damage to the Heart
              (below).
              If a creature doesn't have lungs or the DM decides the
              creature is otherwise immune to such an effect, reroll
              the d% for the critical hit effect.

            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Nervous System (91 - 95):</span>
              The attack damaged your brain,
              spinal cord, or other nervous organ. In addition to taking
              damage as for a normal attack, roll a d4 and suffer the
              according
              Effect:
              1: Your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all
              reduced by 3+X, where X is the critical multiplier of the
              weapon.
              2: You are knocked unconscious.
              3: Your Dexterity is reduced by 8+X, where X is the
              critical multiplier of the weapon.
              4: See the rule for Heart damage (below)
              Brain damage does not recover naturally. Brain
              damage can be repaired by a DC 25+X Heal check, or by
              healing at least 12+X points of damage (X is the critical
              multiplier of the weapon that caused the damage). If you
              rolled a "4" on the d4, these numbers replace the normal
              DCs and numbers for Heart damage.
              If a creature doesn't have a nervous system or the DM
              decides the creature is otherwise immune to such an
              effect, reroll the d% for the critical hit effect.

            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Heart (96 - 100):</span>
              The attack ruptured your heart. You must make
              a DC 25+X Fortitude save (X is the critical multiplier of
              the weapon) or else be immediately reduced to -1 Hit
              Points regardless of your current total. You are dying.
              Unlike being reduced to negative HP by a normal attack,
              you cannot stabilize naturally. Furthermore, the First
              Aid DC increases to 25, and it takes at least 10 points of
              healing to stabilize you. Even if healing brings you into
              the positive numbers of hit points, you are still
              unconscious and dying if the healing wasn't at least 10
              hit points.
              If a creature doesn't have a heart or the DM decides
              the creature is otherwise immune to such an effect,

              When a particular injury says it can be healed
              by healing a certain amount of damage, it doesn't all
              have to be healed in one sitting. You can split the healing
              among multiple healing actions. For instance, you don't
              have to heal 10 damage with a single cure technique to
              repair Heart damage. You could heal 3 damage with one
              healing technique, 5 damage with another, and 2 damage
              with a third. You should keep track of how much
              healing a character has received for the purpose of
              treating special injuries.
              Even if you are healed to maximum HP, special
              injuries are only repaired if you have been healed for the
              required amount of damage. You can still be healed after
              you have reached maximum HP to repair these special

              A critical hit with a nonlethal weapon can only be a
              soft spot, a broken arm, a broken leg, or a nerve hit. If
              anything else is rolled for a nonlethal weapon's critical,

                Techniques that can Avoid an Attack or which can be
                used as a Defensive Maneuver are few and far between,
                but they are a useful staple in many a shinobi's arsenal
                of techniques. These techniques work on the same basic
                principle, as described below.
              </p>
              <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Performing:</span>
                When a technique's descriptive text contains an
                'Avoiding an Attack' or 'Defensive Maneuver' entry, it
                can be performed as an instant action when you are
                targeted by an attack or effect requiring an attack roll
                of any kind. The use of a technique in this way must be
                declared before the result is known (though understandably
                many GM's may not wish to slow down play
                by declaring attacks, in which case they may allow you
                to do it after the hit is confirmed, but before damage is
                known). If you are caught flat-footed or denied your
                Dexterity bonus to Defense against the attack, you cannot
                use a technique in this manner.
                To successfully perform the technique this way, you
                must roll a Perform check for the technique, opposed
                by the result of the attack roll made against you. If the
                attack was a Chakra Control, Genjutsu or Ninjutsu effect,
                the required result increases by 5. If the attack roll
                was a natural 20 or a confirmed critical hit, the required
                result increases by 5 (stacks with the other increase).
                A technique will list a minimum required result,
                if there is one. Not meeting this minimum result
                will mean the attempt fails, even if you scored higher
                than the attack roll. The techniques themselves will
                explain what will happen if you succeed.
                Some techniques will allow you to defend against
                techniques or effects that allow for a save (usually a
                Reflex save) to avoid some of its effects. Any technique
                whose avoidance can do so will specifically say so. The
                Perform DC is opposed by the effect's Save DC (plus 5 if
                it is a technique, as above).
              </p>
              <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Success:</span>
                If you succeed, the attack is either negated (Avoiding
                an Attack, usually by moving away before the attack
                can connect) or partially mitigated (Defensive Maneuver,
                usually by raising obstacles or barriers to absorb
                some or all of the attack). Each technique will specify
                the exact effect.
              </p>
              <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Failure:</span>
                If you fail, the technique is not performed and you are
                affected by the attack as normal (it still needs to hit
                you). Any Chakra spent is wasted.
              </p>
              <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Limitations:</span>
                While useful, these abilities are not all-powerful. Techniques
                can only help you defend against sources up to a
                certain CR (listed in the technique's description), and
                offer Mastery effects to increase the CR against which
                they can defend. Techniques can never defend against
                attacks from sources with a CR higher than your level
                or HD, unless they specifically say they can. Creatures
                can willingly lower their own CR to allow lower-level
                creatures to avoid their attacks (useful when teaching a
                student, for example), but must do so explicitly for each
                attack that could be avoided.
                Furthermore, you are limited to five attempts per day
                to Avoid an Attack and another five attempts per day to
                use a Defensive Maneuver. These uses per day are a
                total, not per technique (for example, if you use Kawarimi
                no Jutsu to Avoid an Attack five times in a given
                day, you can't use Shundou to Avoid an Attack for
                the rest of the day).

              Characters with Constitution modifiers higher than 0 also gain bonus Chakra equal to that modifier each level. 
              Temporary increases in Constitution (or a replacement ability score, if applicable) do not increase Chakra Pool.

              You can activate this ability by concentrating for an attack action. The ability remains active for as long as you 
              continue to concentrate, plus 1d3 rounds.
              The ability allows you to sense lingering Chakra and detect nearby creatures with a strong enough Chakra
              Signature, as above, within 5 ft per level or HD.

              When you touch a living creature, if its Signature is Faint or stronger, you determine the strength of the Signature, 
              and whether it is familiar or not, though you cannot identify it. Functions even when Sense Chakra isn’t active, but does

              to sense the activity (such as a technique) on a creature or area.
              You cannot identify which technique or effect created the traces, but you may be able to
              discern a broad category of effect it belongs to.

              To activate this ability, you must concentrate for one full round. While active, creatures attempting to Sense or

              Concentrating on this ability for another 30 seconds reduces your Signature by another category for every 5 levels or 5 HD you have. 
              Your signature can be reduced as low as fully Suppressed.
              The ability remains active for as long as you continue concentrating on the ability, and for 10 minutes per level or 
              HD you have afterward. Concentrating on this ability is a swift action each round, or an attack action when stressed or threatened.

              This ability is granted by several bloodlines or techniques, which indicate how it can be activated.
              While active, you can see Chakra within your normal line of sight, allowing you to detect the Chakra Signature strength of 
              sources you can see within range. Each Signature has a unique visual representation, but you can only identify individuals if 
              you are intimately familiar with how their Signature looks.
              You can detect Chakra Activities (as per Sense Chakra) by making a Spot check (DC 15 – Chakra spent on activity). Once you’ve 
              detected a Chakra activity this way, if it affected an area, you may use a Spot check instead of the normal skill check required to 
              identify or analyse it (at the same DC).
              You can also focus on a creature or object with traces of activity within 30 feet, making a Spot check with a DC 
              depending on the strength of the aura as shown, giving you a general idea of the type of effect that made the traces.

              Learning a technique takes time. Every attempt made to Learn a technique takes 1 day per Rank of the technique, whether that 
              attempt was successful or not (exceptional rolls may change this, see below). A day of training consists of two blocks of four hours. 
              Each hour spent training drains 10% of your maximum Chakra, though you do not suffer from being depleted while training this way. 
              If you cannot complete a block of four hours (when you run out of Chakra or are interrupted), that block is wasted.
              You can interrupt your training for up to 1 month, after which any progress already attained is lost. If you spend at least one four hour block training within that time, you refresh that timer.

            <p>
              When you beat the Learn DC by 15 or more, decrease the time the attempt takes by 75%.

              Such increases or reductions are rounded up to the nearest 4-hour block (which is half a day).

              There are many ways to learn a technique, as described below. You can only use one of these methods at a time.
            </p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Being Taught:</span>
              You are taught by a character who knows the technique you wish to Learn. Gain a +1 bo-nus to learn checks for each level your 
              teacher is higher than you (minimum +1, maximum +5). If being taught as a group, take the group's average character level and 
              subtract it from the teacher's. The teacher can distribute this bonus among the characters he is teaching
              (minimum +1 per character, maximum +3 per character).
              A teacher with mastery in the technique they teach counts as one level higher per step of mastery they know. 
              At the fifth step of mastery, they grant each pupil one free success (which can be rerolled in an attempt to decrease the time spent, 
              but at the risk of it becoming a failure).
              A teacher must spend at least half of the training time actively tutoring their pupil(s) to grant them the bonus to Learn checks.
            </p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Self-Teaching:</span>
              If you have an item containing enough information about the technique you wish to Learn (such as a scroll), you can 
              teach it to yourself. Such an item grants a +1 bonus to your Learn checks for every 5 points of its Purchase DC 
              (rounded down, restriction not counted; maximum +5). Ninja villages tend to have shops and libraries that will contain many 
              different technique scrolls, but not Hijutsu or Kinjutsu.
            </p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Developing:</span>
              You can learn any technique you've witnessed and identified more than once, without requir-ing a teacher or item to guide you. 
              You suffer a -2 pen-alty to Learn checks and require 1 additional success. Your GM may disallow this method of Learning.
            </p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Creating:</span>
              You can create a technique from scratch, essentially inventing it for yourself. You suffer -2 to learn checks and require 2 
              additional successes when creating a technique. If you are at least 5 levels higher than its rank, you require only 1 extra success. 
              See Appendix A (Technique Creation) for more information on creating new techniques.
              You can create an already existing technique if you only have hints to its effect, but you suffer an additonal -4 
              penalty to learn checks when doing so.

              Performing a technique (except Taijutsu techniques) provokes attacks of opportunity in the same way as casting a spell would 
              (D20 Modern, Table 10-1: FX Actions in Combat, p331). When choosing to perform a technique defensively, the

              All techniques (except Training techniques) have Perform listed in their description. Perform Requirements always carry two components: 
              Skill Threshold and Perform DC. When you perform a technique, first check to see if you meet the Skill Threshold.

            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Skill Threshold</span>
              is equal to the number of skill ranks you have in the relevant skill. Certain class abilities and feats will grant 
              bonuses to your skill threshold with certain types of techniques. If you meet this requirement, you can perform the technique as 
              described be-low. If you do not meet this requirement, you must make a Perform check.
            </p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Perform Checks</span>
              are made by rolling a skill check for the relevant skill. The DC is given in the technique's description. 
              You may spend 1 Chakra to gain a +5 bonus on this check. If you succeed, you perform the technique as normal. 
              If you fail, the technique is not performed, but the action is wasted.
            </p>
            <p class="details__body"> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Increasing Perform Requirements</span>
              sometimes required (for example, some techniques may require you to do so to receive improved effects). To do so, 
              simply increase the Skill Threshold and Perform DC by the amount indicated.

              An entangled character takes a –2 penalty
              on attack rolls in addition to a –4 penalty to Dexterity. If
              the entangling bonds are anchored to an immobile
              object, the entangled hero can’t move. Otherwise, he can
              move at half speed, but can’t run or charge.
              Entangled characters also suffer a -4
              penalty to Speed Ranks.

              –6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After 1 hour of complete,
              uninterrupted rest, an exhausted character becomes
              fatigued. Exhausted characters also suffer a -2

              A fascinated creature sits or stands quietly,
              wholly focused on the effect causing the condition,
              and takes no other actions. They take a -4
              penalty to Spot and Listen checks made as a reaction
              to something. A potential threat (like a hostile
              creature approaching) allows a new saving throw
              against the effect. An obviously lethal threat (like
              someone drawing a weapon or aiming something at
              the creature) automatically breaks the effect. A fascinated
              creature can be freed by an ally, which requires
              a standard action to do.
